/**
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * [0,1,3,5,6] -> ans is 3 because we have 3 values that are equal to or greater than 3. 1 is also valid but we want to maximize the answer
 * [0,1,4,5,6] -> ans cannot be 4 because we don't have 4 values that are equal to or greater than 4. The answer is still 3.
