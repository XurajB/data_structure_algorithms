    A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
    Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, or Bubble Sort, etc.
    In the case of Bucket sort, input sorts themselves by moving into a bucket and their order are not guaranteed to be retained.
