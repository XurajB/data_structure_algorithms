/**
 * Created by Xuraj on 12/27/2019.
 *
 * Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree - Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph
 * is a sub-graph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees.
 * A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected
 * graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
 * The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
 *
 * A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
 * Steps -
 * 1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
 * 2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
 * 3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
 *
 * Step 2 is performed using union-find algorithm
