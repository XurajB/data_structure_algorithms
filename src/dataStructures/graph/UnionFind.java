/**
 * disjoint sets: no common elements
 * A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
 * A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:
 *
 * Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
 * Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
 *
 * Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not.
 * This method assumes that the graph doesnâ€™t contain any self-loops.
 * We can keep track of the subsets in a 1D array, called parent[].
