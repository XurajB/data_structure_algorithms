/**
 * The state pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of a finite-state machine.
 * The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the patternâ€™s interface.
 *
 * This class acts as a context. It also maintains a reference to one of the state classes that represent the current state of audio player
